Hi from Cam
Hello! This is Dave putting in my update!
Hi. I am Ben. I am learning the GitHub.

We're using a GitHub organization for our account which means we have two repositories.

The first is the Frontend which will contain the website code.
The second is the Agent which will contain the agent code.

Both can be viewed here:
